# sha[dva]rma

A proof-of-concept WebGL2 salted SHA256 password hashes buteforcer.

This code can oly brute-force hashes from certain types of passwords:

- length should equal 5
- chars are "printable ASCII": uppercase latin, lowercase latin, digits and specials.

so if you're looking for a hacking tool, this stuff is useless for you. This purpose of this project is purely educational/demo.
